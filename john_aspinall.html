	<p>Mr Aspinall (60) was the third generation of his family to farm Mt Aspiring Station, but he did not let the station’s geographic isolation, 40km from Wanaka, prevent him from becoming a farming leader. He was a member of Federated Farmers’ National Board, and advocating for property rights and what he called common-sense conservation.</p>
	<p>He once estimated 80,000 people a year drove past his gate accessing Mt Aspiring National Park, and he never tired of sharing his family’s special corner of the world, stopping to have a chat or opening the door to the homestead he shared with wife Sue and their three children.</p>
	<p>Despite being at the forefront of emotional and sometimes polarised debates about managing the high country, the property rights of Crown pastoral lessees and public access, Mr Aspinall maintained his dignity and ethics, remaining respectful of opposing views. He also practised what he preached, believing sustainable management of the land, the environment and the farm business unit were all vital ingredients to manage the high country. That approach was recognised with his winning of the Ballance Farm Environment Award in 2006.</p>
	<p>The pastoral lease was settled by Jack and Amy Aspinall in 1920 and passed to Mr Aspinall’s parents Jerry and Phyllis in 1950, who surrendered a large area to the Government which was to form the basis of Mt Aspiring National Park.  John and Sue Aspinall took over the reins of the 10,000ha property in 1977. In 2010, they retired to Wanaka when son Randall and his wife Allison took over, but he still travelled to the farm most days.</p>
	<p>Mr Aspinall and his father both attended Otago Boys’ High School, and when they built a new homestead, the school and Dunstan High School were given use of the family’s former home as an outdoor education camp. More than 10,000 Otago Boys’ boys have spent time in the valley.</p>
	<p>The remoteness of the property meant primary school was by correspondence, overseen by his mother, and in a 2006 interview he gave an insight into those early days in the Matukituki Valley. ‘‘Where else can you do Correspondence School in the morning, farming in the afternoon, go up the river and catch a fish then head into the bush and shoot a deer, and be back home and in bed by dark?’’</p>
	<p>Secondary school was boarding at OBHS, a move he recalled as a major culture shock.  He studied at OBHS until seventh form and then spent four years at Lincoln College, completing a bachelor of agricultural science degree which he achieved with honours, before returning to Mt Aspiring Station.</p>
	<p>John Aspinall practised what he preached, increasing the number of animals farmed and developing the land without sacrificing conservation and environmental values, in part by leaving areas of the station ungrazed.  Federated Farmers colleague Bruce McNab described Mr Aspinall as an outstanding advocate for sensible high-country management.</p>
	<p>'‘He had a quiet humility but was courageous and forthright when necessary. [He was] not afraid to stand up in a crowd and say what he believed. John had the knack of quickly getting to the core of a subject and providing a balanced and accurate analysis.’’</p>
